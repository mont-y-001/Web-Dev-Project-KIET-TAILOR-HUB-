🧵 Tailor Hub – MERN Stack Web Application

Tailor Hub is a modern MERN-stack web application created for the KIET MCA Web Development Project. It is designed to help local tailors bring their services online, making it easier for customers to book stitching and alteration services digitally. The platform solves the lack of online visibility and manual order handling faced by small tailors by providing a complete online solution where tailors and customers interact seamlessly.

Tailor Hub provides secure role-based authentication for customers and tailors using JWT. Tailors can manage their service listings, upload images, set pricing, and handle customer orders by updating their progress from pending to in-progress and finally completed. Customers can browse tailor profiles, explore available services, place custom stitching or alteration requests, and track their order status through a responsive dashboard. The system is fully API-driven and offers smooth frontend-backend communication through REST APIs.

The frontend is developed using React.js, supported by React Router for navigation and Axios for API requests. TailwindCSS or Bootstrap can be used for styling to ensure a clean, responsive, and modern user interface. The backend uses Node.js and Express.js, implementing secure authentication and clean API structuring. MongoDB with Mongoose is used as the primary database to store users, services, and orders, while image handling is supported via Cloudinary or Multer.
